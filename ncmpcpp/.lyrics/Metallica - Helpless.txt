I gotta see you moving fast
See you come my way
See the dreams, I hope they last
Never fade away

Gotta see the lights above
Make it loud tonight
Gotta set it all a-fire
Set it all a-light

See the flashing lights
Hear the thunder roar
I am gonna set you all a-light
Gotta make it man
I ain't got a choice
Gotta fill this hall tonight

Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless

I don't what I'm gonna do
Maybe not tonight
Gotta set you all a-fire
Gotta treat you right

I can see the flashing lights
Lit before your love, oh
Gotta hear the thunder roar
Coming from above

See the flashing lights
Hear the thunder roar
I'm gonna set you all alight
Gotta make it man
I ain't got no choice
Gotta fill this hall tonight

Helpless
Helpless
Helpless
Helpless

I can see the stars
I can see what's going on

Every night alone
I sing my song just for fun

Only time will tell
If I'll make it myself someday
This stage is mine
Music is my destiny

Cannot squeeze the life from me

I can see the lights
But I can see what's going on
Every night alone
I sing my song just for fun

Business in collapse
Some men don't like it so
Helpless maybe babe
But you can leave or join the show

Cannot squeeze the life from me
